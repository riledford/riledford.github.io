The account that I created for GitHub is only going to be used for school and I can save any repositories or projects that I start. 


The repository that I created will be used to add files for lab assignments that we do in the future. 
It is made public so anyone can see it. I can invite anyone to be able to view my repository. If I'm working on a project with someone else, we can both code at the same time, and if I make a mistake, they can fix it. 

I created the repository by clicking the "Clone a repository from the internet" button and then I clicked on the repository that I had made, picked to have it cloned in the Assignments folder, clicked the "Clone repository" button, and then it got cloned on my computer.
